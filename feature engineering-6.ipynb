    "To examine the relationship between age and preference for a particular brand of soft drink based on the given survey results, we need to analyze the data to see if there are any patterns or trends. It seems there are three variables: Age (in years), Soft Drink Preference (e.g., coke, pepsi, mountain dew), and possibly the number of individuals for each preference category. However, the number of individuals for each preference category is not provided. Assuming that there is one individual per preference, we can summarize the data as follows:\n",

    "19         | Coke\n",
    "31         | Pepsi\n",
    "28         | Coke\n",
    "To examine the relationship between age and soft drink preference, we can use various statistical methods, such as cross-tabulation, to identify any associations between the two variables. Here's a simple way to analyze the data:\n",
    "1. Create a Cross-tabulation (Contingency Table):\n",
    "Create a table to show the frequency distribution of each age group's preference for the soft drink brands:\n",
    "\n",
    "         | Coke | Pepsi | Mountain Dew\n",

    "Age 20-30| 2    | 1     | 0\n",
    "Age 30-40| 1    | 1     | 0\n",
    "Age > 40 | 0    | 1     | 1\n",
    "2. Analyze the Cross-tabulation:\n",
    "From the cross-tabulation, we can observe how many individuals from each age group preferred each soft drink brand. However, to determine the strength and significance of the relationship between age and soft drink preference, more advanced statistical methods like chi-square test or logistic regression might be used.\n",
    "Keep in mind that the sample size is small, and the data provided is limited. To draw more robust conclusions and make generalizations about the population, a larger and more representative sample would be required. Additionally, the survey results might not reflect the actual preferences of the entire population as it only represents a subset of individuals."
