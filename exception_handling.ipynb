    "### Ans: In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, which disrupts the normal flow of the program. It represents an error or exceptional condition that needs to be handled by the program. When an exception occurs, the program raises an exception object, which can then be caught and handled using exception handling mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can occur due to various reasons, such as invalid input, division by zero, file not found, network errors, and so on. Python provides a built-in hierarchy of exception classes, which cover different types of errors that can occur during program execution. Examples of built-in exception classes in Python include `TypeError`, `ValueError`, `FileNotFoundError`, and `ZeroDivisionError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, syntax errors are a different category of errors that occur when the code violates the syntax rules of the programming language. Syntax errors occur during the parsing of the code and prevent the code from being executed at all. They are typically caused by misspellings, incorrect indentation, missing punctuation, or incorrect use of programming language constructs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key differences between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Occurrence: Exceptions occur during the runtime of a program when an exceptional condition arises, while syntax errors are detected during the parsing of the code and prevent the program from running.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Handling: Exceptions can be caught and handled using try-except blocks or other exception handling mechanisms, allowing the program to gracefully handle and recover from errors. Syntax errors cannot be caught and handled as they prevent the code from running at all. They need to be fixed by correcting the syntax of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cause: Exceptions occur due to specific conditions or situations that arise during program execution, such as invalid input or unexpected behavior. Syntax errors occur due to violations of the programming language's syntax rules, such as incorrect syntax or structure of the code.\n",
