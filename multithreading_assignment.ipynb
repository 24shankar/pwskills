    "### Ans: The `threading` module in Python is used to handle threads, providing a high-level interface for creating, managing, and synchronizing threads. It offers various functions and classes to facilitate thread-based programming. Here are the explanations for the functions you mentioned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) `activeCount()`: This function returns the number of Thread objects currently alive. It gives the count of threads that are currently running or in a paused state. It is helpful for monitoring the number of active threads in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example usage:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "   def my_function():\n",
    "       print(\"Hello from thread!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   thread1 = threading.Thread(target=my_function)\n",
    "   thread1.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(\"Active thread count:\", threading.activeCount())\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Output:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Hello from thread!\n",
    "   Active thread count: 2\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2) `currentThread()`: This function returns the currently executing Thread object. It provides a way to access the Thread object representing the current thread from within the thread's code. It can be used, for example, to obtain information about the current thread or to synchronize operations on shared resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example usage:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "   def my_function():\n",
    "       current_thread = threading.currentThread()\n",

    "   thread1 = threading.Thread(target=my_function)\n",
    "   thread1.start()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Output:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Current thread name: Thread-1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3) `enumerate()`: This function returns a list of all Thread objects currently alive. It provides a way to obtain a list of all active threads in the program. Each thread is represented by a Thread object, and this function allows you to access and work with each individual thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example usage:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import threading\n",
    "\n",

    "### Ans: 1) `run()`: The `run()` method is the entry point for the thread's activity. It contains the code that will be executed when the thread starts. It is typically overridden in a subclass to define the specific task or job that the thread should perform.\n",
    "   Example usage:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import threading\n",
    "   class MyThread(threading.Thread):\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "2) `start()`: The `start()` method is used to start the execution of a thread. It initiates the thread's activity and invokes the `run()` method asynchronously. When `start()` is called, a new thread of execution is created, and the `run()` method of the thread is executed concurrently.\n",
    "   Example usage:\n",

    "   Hello from thread!\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3) `join()`: The `join()` method is used to block the execution of the current thread until a specific thread has completed its execution. It allows the current thread to wait for the completion of another thread before continuing its own execution.\n",
    "   Example usage:\n",
    "   ```python\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "   Hello from thread!\n",
    "   Thread execution completed.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "4) `isAlive()`: The `isAlive()` method is used to check whether a thread is currently alive or not. It returns a Boolean value indicating the thread's current status: `True` if the thread is still alive and `False` otherwise.\n",
    "   Example usage:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import threading\n",

    "### Ans: Advantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "1. Improved Performance: Multithreading allows for concurrent execution of multiple tasks, utilizing the available CPU cores efficiently. This can lead to improved performance and reduced execution time for certain types of applications, especially those with computationally intensive or I/O-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Responsiveness: Multithreading can enhance the responsiveness of applications, particularly in scenarios where certain operations may take a long time to complete. By executing time-consuming tasks in separate threads, the main thread remains free to handle user interactions or other critical operations without blocking.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Resource Sharing: Threads within the same process share the same memory space, allowing for easy and efficient sharing of data. This facilitates communication and coordination between different parts of the program, making it simpler to pass data and share resources between threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Parallelism: Multithreading enables parallelism by running multiple threads simultaneously. This is particularly beneficial for tasks that can be divided into smaller, independent units of work that can be executed concurrently. Parallel execution can significantly speed up the completion of such tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "1. Complexity: Multithreaded programming can be more complex than single-threaded programming. It introduces challenges such as synchronization, thread safety, and avoiding race conditions. Dealing with shared data and coordinating threads requires careful design and implementation to ensure correctness and avoid unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Increased Overhead: Multithreading introduces overhead in terms of memory usage and CPU time due to thread creation, management, and synchronization mechanisms. This overhead can reduce the performance benefits gained from parallel execution, especially when dealing with tasks that have fine-grained parallelism or threads that frequently synchronize.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Concurrency Issues: Multithreading can introduce concurrency issues such as race conditions, deadlocks, and thread starvation if not handled properly. These issues arise when multiple threads access shared resources simultaneously and can lead to incorrect program behavior or program freezes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Debugging and Testing: Debugging and testing multithreaded programs can be more challenging than single-threaded programs. Reproducing and diagnosing issues related to thread interactions and synchronization can be complex. Testing all possible interleavings of thread execution can also be difficult, making it harder to ensure the correctness of the program."

    "### Ans: Deadlocks and race conditions are common concurrency issues that can occur in multithreaded programs. Let's understand each of these concepts:\n",
    "1. Deadlock:\n",
    "A deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release resources. In a deadlock, none of the involved threads can proceed, resulting in a program freeze or deadlock state. Deadlocks occur due to improper resource allocation and synchronization.\n",
    "A deadlock typically involves the following four conditions, known as the Coffman conditions:\n",
    "- Mutual Exclusion: At least one resource must be held in a non-shareable mode, meaning that only one thread can use it at a time.\n",
    "- Hold and Wait: A thread must be holding at least one resource while waiting to acquire additional resources held by other threads.\n",
    "- No Preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from a thread; they must be released voluntarily.\n",
    "- Circular Wait: There exists a circular chain of two or more threads, each waiting for a resource held by the next thread in the chain.\n",
    "To resolve deadlocks, it is important to carefully manage resource allocation and ensure that the Coffman conditions are not violated. Techniques such as resource ordering, deadlock detection, and deadlock avoidance algorithms can be employed to prevent or recover from deadlocks.\n",
    "2. Race Condition:\n",
    "A race condition occurs when the behavior of a program depends on the relative timing or interleaving of multiple threads accessing shared resources. It arises when multiple threads access and manipulate shared data concurrently, without proper synchronization. The result of a race condition is unpredictable and can lead to incorrect program output or behavior.\n",
    "Race conditions commonly occur when multiple threads read and write shared data simultaneously. The outcome of such operations depends on the timing and interleaving of the threads, which can lead to inconsistent or unexpected results.\n",
    "To mitigate race conditions, synchronization mechanisms such as locks, mutexes, and semaphores can be used to coordinate access to shared resources. These mechanisms ensure that only one thread can access the shared data at a time, preventing race conditions and maintaining data integrity."
