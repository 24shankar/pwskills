    "## Pandas provides a wide range of functions to manipulate and transform data in a DataFrame. Here are some commonly used functions:\n",
    "1. `head()` and `tail()`: These functions allow you to view the first or last few rows of a DataFrame, respectively. They are useful for quickly inspecting the data. For example, you might use `df.head()` to get a glimpse of the first few records in a large dataset.\n",
    "2. `info()`: This function provides a summary of the DataFrame, including the column names, data types, and non-null counts. It is helpful for understanding the structure of the data. For instance, you might use `df.info()` to check if any columns have missing values.\n",
    "3. `describe()`: This function generates descriptive statistics of the numeric columns in the DataFrame, such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartile values. It gives you a statistical summary of the data. For example, you might use `df.describe()` to get an overview of the central tendencies and spread of the numerical data.\n",
    "4. `sort_values()`: This function allows you to sort the DataFrame by one or more columns. You can specify the column(s) by which to sort and the order (ascending or descending). It is useful for arranging the data in a specific order. For instance, you might use `df.sort_values('Age', ascending=False)` to sort the DataFrame by the 'Age' column in descending order.\n",
    "5. `groupby()`: This function is used to group the data based on one or more columns. It enables you to perform aggregate operations on subsets of the data. You can then apply functions like `sum()`, `mean()`, `count()`, etc., to calculate summary statistics within each group. For example, you might use `df.groupby('Gender')['Age'].mean()` to calculate the average age for each gender in the DataFrame.\n",
    "6. `fillna()`: This function allows you to fill missing values in the DataFrame with a specified value or a method such as forward fill (`ffill()`) or backward fill (`bfill()`). It helps in handling missing data. For instance, you might use `df.fillna(0)` to replace all missing values in the DataFrame with zeros."

    "Series and DataFrame in Pandas are mutable because you can modify their values, add or remove columns/rows, and apply operations that change the data within them. For example, you can update specific values in a Series or DataFrame, add new columns or rows, and perform operations like merging, grouping, or filtering that modify the structure or content of the data.\n",
    "On the other hand, Panel is not mutable in Pandas. Panel is a three-dimensional data structure that was available in earlier versions of Pandas. However, starting from Pandas version 0.20.0, Panel has been deprecated, and the recommended practice is to use MultiIndex DataFrame or other data structures for similar use cases. Therefore, since Panel is not part of the current Pandas design and is not recommended for use, it is not mutable."
