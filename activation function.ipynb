    "Activation functions play a crucial role in the training process and performance of a neural network. They impact how the network learns, converges, and generalizes. Here's how different activation functions affect these aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Non-Linearity:**\n",
    "Activation functions introduce non-linearity to the network, allowing it to model complex relationships in data. Without non-linearity, the network would behave like a linear model, limiting its ability to represent intricate patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Training Speed:**\n",
    "The choice of activation function affects the training speed of a neural network. Activation functions like ReLU and its variants (Leaky ReLU, ELU) tend to accelerate training because they allow gradient to flow easily for positive inputs. Sigmoid and tanh functions can saturate for large inputs, leading to slow convergence due to the vanishing gradient problem.\n",

    "ReLU-based activation functions can lead to \"dead neurons\" that never activate (always output zero) because their weights get updated in a way that they never recover. This is addressed by variants like Leaky ReLU and ELU.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Smoothness:**\n",
    "Activation functions like sigmoid and tanh are smooth across their entire range, which can lead to smoother transitions in the network's output. ReLU and its variants have piecewise linear behavior, which can cause less smoothness at the origin.\n",
    "\n",

    "Different activation functions have different output ranges. Sigmoid outputs values between 0 and 1, which can be suitable for binary classification.

    "The hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation function is a non-linear activation function commonly used in artificial neural networks. It shares some similarities with the sigmoid activation function but has a different range and properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tanh function maps the input values to a range between -1 and 1, making it zero-centered. Mathematically, the tanh activation function is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{tanh}(x) = \\frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, \\( x \\) is the input value, and \\( e \\) is the base of the natural logarithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Working of the Tanh Activation Function:**\n",
    "- For inputs around 0, tanh outputs values close to zero.\n",
    "- For positive inputs, tanh outputs values close to 1.\n",
    "- For negative inputs, tanh outputs values close to -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison between Tanh and Sigmoid Activation Functions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Range of Output:**\n",
    "   - Sigmoid: Outputs values between 0 and 1.\n",
    "   - Tanh: Outputs values between -1 and 1, making it zero-centered.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Non-Linearity:**\n",
    "   - Both sigmoid and tanh are sigmoidal functions with an S-shaped curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Symmetry and Zero-Centered:**\n",
    "   - Sigmoid: Outputs are strictly positive, and it is not zero-centered.\n",
    "   - Tanh: Outputs are centered around zero, with both positive and negative values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Vanishing Gradient:**\n",
    "   - Both sigmoid and tanh can suffer from the vanishing gradient problem for large inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Advantages of Tanh over Sigmoid:**\n",
    "   - Zero-Centered Outputs: The zero-centered outputs of tanh can be advantageous in training deep networks, as it helps in symmetric learning and optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Disadvantages of Tanh:**\n",
    "   - Like sigmoid, tanh activations can saturate for very large or very small inputs, causing gradients to vanish.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use Tanh Activation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tanh activation is suitable for scenarios where zero-centered outputs are desired, especially when training deep neural networks. However, due to the saturation and vanishing gradient issues, other activation functions like ReLU and its variants are often preferred, especially in deep networks. Tanh may still be used in some cases, such as in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) where its zero-centered nature can help with convergence."
