It is typically used for small sample sizes (typically less than 30) and when the population standard deviation is not available. The test statistic in a t-test follows a t-distribution, which takes into account the variability introduced by the estimation of the population standard deviation from the sample.\n",

    "### Bayes's theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs or assess the probability of an event based on new evidence. It involves the calculation of conditional probabilities. The theorem is named after the Reverend Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century statistician.\n",
    "Bayes's theorem states:\n",
    "P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- P(A|B) represents the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred.\n",
    "- P(B|A) represents the probability of event B occurring given that event A has occurred.\n",
    "- P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of events A and B occurring independently of each other.\n",
    "To illustrate Bayes's theorem, let's consider a medical example:\n",
    "Suppose a certain medical condition affects 1% of the population. A test has been developed to detect this condition, and it is known to correctly identify the presence of the condition 95% of the time (true positive rate) and correctly identify the absence of the condition 90% of the time (true negative rate).\n",
    "Now, let's say you take the test and it comes back positive. You might naturally wonder, \"What is the probability that I actually have the condition?\"\n",
    "To use Bayes's theorem, we need to assign labels to the events involved:\n",
    "- Event A: Having the medical condition.\n",
    "- Event B: Testing positive.\n",
    "Given the information provided, we can calculate the probability of having the condition given a positive test result.\n",
    "P(A) = 0.01 (prevalence of the condition in the population)\n",
    "P(B|A) = 0.95 (true positive rate)\n",
    "P(~B|~A) = 0.90 (true negative rate, complement of B given ~A)\n",
    "Now, we can calculate the probability of testing positive (P(B)) using the law of total probability:\n",
    "P(B) = P(A) * P(B|A) + P(~A) * P(B|~A)\n",
    "     = 0.01 * 0.95 + 0.99 * (1 - 0.90)\n",
    "     = 0.01 * 0.95 + 0.99 * 0.10\n",
    "     = 0.0095 + 0.099\n",
    "     = 0.1085\n",
    "Finally, we can apply Bayes's theorem to calculate the probability of having the condition given a positive test result:\n",

    "       = (0.95 * 0.01) / 0.1085\n",
    "       ≈ 0.0876\n",
    "Therefore, given a positive test result, the probability of actually having the condition is approximately 0.0876 or 8.76%.\n",

    "A confidence interval is a range of values that provides an estimate of the plausible range for an unknown population parameter, such as the population mean or proportion. It is accompanied by a confidence level, which represents the probability that the interval contains the true population parameter. In other words, a confidence interval provides a measure of the uncertainty associated with estimating population parameters based on sample data.\n",
    "To calculate a confidence interval, the following steps are generally followed:\n",
    "1. Determine the desired confidence level: Common choices are 90%, 95%, or 99%. A 95% confidence level is often used, indicating that we are 95% confident that the true population parameter lies within the interval.\n",
    "2. Collect a sample from the population and calculate the sample statistics: For example, if estimating the population mean, calculate the sample mean (x̄) and sample standard deviation (s).\n",
    "3. Select the appropriate distribution: The choice of distribution depends on the sample size and whether the population standard deviation is known. For large sample sizes or known population standard deviation, the standard normal distribution (z-distribution) is used. For small sample sizes and unknown population standard deviation, the t-distribution is used.\n",
    "4. Determine the critical value: The critical value corresponds to the desired confidence level and the selected distribution. It is found in the respective distribution's table or can be calculated using software.\n",
    "5. Calculate the margin of error: The margin of error represents the maximum distance from the sample estimate that the population parameter is likely to be. It is determined by multiplying the critical value by the standard error.\n",
    "6. Calculate the confidence interval: The confidence interval is constructed by taking the sample estimate and adding/subtracting the margin of error.\n",
    "Now, let's illustrate the calculation of a confidence interval with an example:\n",
    "Suppose we want to estimate the average weight (μ) of a particular species of fish in a lake. We collect a random sample of 50 fish and measure their weights. The sample mean weight is 500 grams, and the sample standard deviation is 20 grams.\n",
    "We decide to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the population mean weight.\n",
    "1. The desired confidence level is 95%.\n",
    "2. Sample statistics: x̄ (sample mean) = 500 grams, s (sample standard deviation) = 20 grams.\n",
    "3. Since the sample size is large, we can use the standard normal distribution (z-distribution).\n",
    "4. The critical value for a 95% confidence level in the standard normal distribution is approximately 1.96 (obtained from tables or software).\n",
    "5. Margin of error: Multiply the critical value by the standard error, which is calculated as s / √n, where n is the sample size.\n",
    "   Margin of error = 1.96 * (20 / √50) ≈ 5.53 grams.\n",
    "6. Confidence interval: Construct the interval by adding/subtracting the margin of error from the sample mean.\n",
    "   Confidence interval = 500 ± 5.53\n",
    "                      = (494.47, 505.53) grams.\n",
    "Interpreting the result: We can be 95% confident that the true average weight of the fish in the lake lies between 494.47 grams and 505.53 grams based on the sample data.\n",
    "The confidence interval provides a range of values within which the population parameter is likely to fall, taking into account the variability in the sample data. It is a useful tool for making statistical inferences and understanding the precision of our estimates."

    "The z-score measures how many standard deviations a data point is away from the mean. In this case, a z-score of 1 indicates that the data point at 75 is 1 standard deviation above the population mean of 70.\n",
    "Since the z-score is positive, it means the data point is higher than the mean. The magnitude of the z-score, which is 1 in this case, indicates the relative distance between the data point and the mean in terms of standard deviations.\n",
    "Z-scores are commonly used to compare data points across different populations or to assess the relative position of a data point within a distribution. A positive z-score suggests that the data point is above the mean, while a negative z-score would indicate a value below the mean."
